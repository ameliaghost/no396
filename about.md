Words are my favorite thing. Some people call me a wordsmith. I used to be a designer, but it turns out I like designing for myself more than I like reading minds. I meander. I write. I make things pretty. I make things work. My left and right brains quarrel and spat.

I pick my paragraphs.

I have a masters degree in tinkering with design and technology from the [University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au/architecture/programs_of_study/postgraduate/IDEA.shtml) and a bachelor of architecture from the [University of Kansas](http://sadp.ku.edu/).

Making tiny buildings is one of those random skills I've learned that is most useless and most fun. Don't tell anyone, but I'm going to build a scale model of Jabba's Palace soon. (There can be no more worthy purpose in having gone to architecture school than this.)

In another lifetime back when I was awfully young, I had a full piano studio and was a successful teacher. It was a happy accident that turned into a successful career. If you have a piano, I may press a few keys. 

Currently, I am working as a prolific emailer, guru and leader of shifts for a trendy startup. You may have heard of [us](http://www.squarespace.com). They call me the customer whisperer.

I spend all of my free time and most of my taken time with [him](http://www.championsonsea.com).
