Words are my favorite thing. Some people call me a wordsmith. I used to be a designer, but it turns out I like designing for myself more than I like reading minds. I meander. I write. I make things pretty. I make things work. My left and right brains quarrel and spat.

I pick my paragraphs.

I have a masters degree in tinkering with design and technology from the <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/architecture/programs_of_study/postgraduate/IDEA.shtml" target="_blank">University of Sydney</a> and a bachelor of architecture from the <a href="http://sadp.ku.edu/" target="_blank">University of Kansas</a>.

Making tiny buildings is one of those random skills I've learned that is most useless and most fun. Don't tell anyone, but I'm going to build a scale model of Jabba's Palace soon. (There can be no more worthy purpose in having gone to architecture school than this.)

In another lifetime back when I was awfully young, I had a full piano studio and was a successful teacher. It was a happy accident that turned into a successful career. If you have a piano, I may press a few keys. 

Currently, I am working as a prolific emailer, guru and leader of shifts for a trendy startup. They call me the customer whisperer.

I spend all of my free time and most of my taken time with <a href="http://www.championsonsea.com" target="_blank">him</a>.
