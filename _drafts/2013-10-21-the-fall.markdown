Every time she gets quiet, every time she closes her eyes, my heart snags and a quick and trembling fear sets in saying *she died.* I check on her. I make sure she’s breathing. I look to see that her chest is moving. Of course she’s breathing. She isn’t just going to stop breathing one moment and peacefully be gone. Cancer takes awhile. It won't be peaceful. But it isn’t an irrational fear.
