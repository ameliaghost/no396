my experience with collecting action figures as a woman in my 30s. 2361 words, no caps.

i grew up a long time ago. i have had a lot of education, a lot of job history and a lot of moving around the world in the last ten or so years of my life.

along the way i've quit a lot of maddeningly bad jobs and been hurt by a lot of maddeningly selfish guys and somewhere in all of that i forgot how to have fun. i used to have favorite things: a favorite tv show, favorite possessions, favorite activities to do but i discovered recently that i didn't have any of these anymore. i sold all of my things, i stopped watching my favorite tv show. i guess i stopped caring. or knowing how to care. or believing i should care.

i saw other adults with the things they love, and i couldn't understand. why do you love that show? it's stupid. why do you have that knick-knack? it's childish. why do you keep spending your money on that hobby? are you possibly getting fulfillment from it? i guess i was cynical, because the world had dealt me enough blows that i pulled away from the idea of "fun".

and then i met him.

we'll call him j.

here was this intelligent, mysterious, well-spoken, kindhearted man who was more thoughtful than most, careful with his words, delightful to speak to and intellectually engaged with me in a way that formed a connection between us i have rarely felt with another. possibly never, not at the level of our communication and care for each other.

i went months admiring the intelligence and depths of his mind. our conversations were literary. they were historical. they delved into topics that could so easily lend to a pretentious outcome, and yet they never did. every time i spoke to him, i learned something new. i looked forward to hearing from him, and over time, our contact slowly morphed into a constant, open stream of communication, and as such, we allowed ourselves to learn and know each other in a deep and intimate way. 

when i started a new job that gave me access to free websites, i needed ideas for what to make out of my sites. of course i went straight to him. he has a never ending supply of creative ideas. it was during one of these conversations that one evening he said to me, "i have an idea that might be a good website."

"oh?"

"i wrote an essay once, and i think it could be turned into a good website."

i assumed it was going to be a topic on history, a passion of his. but the essay i got from him showed me an entirely new side of him he hadn't yet let me see. 

it was an essay about a cartoon â€“ his favorite as a child. he had revisited it as an adult and after watching every episode again, he wrote a long, hilarious essay about the experience. i read the essay, with delight and laughter, and then i made a website based off of it. but having read the essay and taking the time to make the website, i found that i was curious about this show. i had heard of it growing up. maybe i had even seen episodes of it, though i don't actually recall. so i ordered several seasons on dvd and he and i started watching together. it became another shared experience for us. his enthusiasm for this quirky, nonsensical tv show was contagious, and i truly enjoyed watching it too. it started off that i was enjoying doing it with him, and though that hasn't changed at all, it has become something i also enjoy. me. at 35 years old. i enjoy a cartoon.

watching this show together brought about new conversations for us. he started asking me what silly things i like. "i don't know. nothing, really." i would answer. i couldn't think of anything. 

"well, what did you like when you were a kid?"

"i guess i liked a few shows." i would name a few, and though i remember liking them, i couldn't remember what my favorite was.

through our conversations, i began to realize that i had nothing fun. i didn't know how to have fun. i had no toys or favorite tv shows. i hadn't bought anything for myself that wasn't completely necessary in years.

"you need to treat yourself. life is too short for you to not spend the money you earn on things you enjoy." he started to say to me. 

"but i don't even know what i enjoy."

"find something."

i spent hours looking at things on amazon. nothing appealed to me.

"i want you to buy something fun for yourself every month." he said to me.

it sounded like a fantastic idea. i can afford it now, after all. but i didn't even know what i could buy that i would like. he told me one day that he did something he shouldn't have done.

my curiosity piqued.

"i bought them. all of them."

all of what, you might wonder. he dropped a lot of money on toys. toys of the action figures from that cartoon. these are not cheap toys, and there are a lot of them. and did i mention, we're in our 30s. 

"no!" i countered back to him. i didn't want him to feel bad or stupid for splurging on something silly like this. this isn't a bad thing. this is a wonderful thing. i wish i had something silly and playful i could spend my money on. i've got nothing. 

he started writing reviews of each character, and would send me these amazing pictures he had taken. he was having fun with them, and i was having fun vicariously through him. i was even a little jealous that he had this passion. 

i don't remember how it started.

maybe he told me to? maybe i said i wanted to?

i don't even remember.

but i bought one. i bought batman. if i couldn't find something i wanted for my fun thing for each month, then i would get something fun that he likes instead.

and then i bought another.

and then more. 

and i discovered that i loved these little toys. 

i loved that i was finally having fun. but i also felt a little strange, like i was hijacking his fun and these weren't really my thing. that somehow i was faking it and i would get called out on it. "you don't really love comics. you're just trying too hard." or whatever thing some other person who doesn't know or understand and could never appreciate the relationship i have with him might say.

but fuck to that.

i was having fun. it was my fun. i was the one enjoying this. and i was having fun with him. we have been engaged with each other in new ways as a result of this new shared hobby of ours. i still learn new things from him every day. maybe it isn't always about shakespeare or the saxons, but it is still new knowledge. one day i might learn about dr. fate. another day i'll learn about action figure joints. but always he and i are having fun together with this shared interest. it may have started off as his thing. and maybe i did jump on his bandwagon. but it happened because it's contagious and he allowed and encouraged me to participate with him. now it isn't just his thing. it's my thing too. it's our thing. it keeps him afloat, and i have something fun in my life.

he taught me how to have fun again.

i'm not ashamed of my new love for toys. if anything, i'm ashamed of the woman who forgot how to have fun. of the woman who would have judged someone else for it.

what isn't to love about a toy that looks as badass as hawkman? look at his wings! that's a toy!

![hawkman]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hawkman.jpg)

and what isn't to love about the way fucked up joker (he's got no fingers!) gave us something to hate and be annoyed about *together*?

we laughed together through our shared irritation with a seller that would classify this as a "like new" collectible. 

and what isn't to love about the way he and i get excited for the mail to come? or for payday to roll around again so i can buy more toys? he asks me what my favorite one is, often, and i struggle to give him an answer. i think hard, and i struggle. but i do have an answer tonight, as i write this. i have a favorite. i've known it for awhile now. 

ever since i was little, superman was my favorite superhero. but i wouldn't call him my favorite action figure. he's a good looking figure (when his arm doesn't fall off). i find that he stands easily, which is kind of a big deal for me, because i suck at making them stand. i really like the figure. the character is nostalgic for me, so the figure appeals.

superman came with this ugly dude, parasite. i was less than excited about getting him.

who wants a douchcanoe like that little fuck? he's ugly. he's a nobody. i'm assuming superman defeats him ("for the last time") whenever he came around to stir up trouble. i suspect dc only packages him with superman because nobody would buy him otherwise. but if nobody is going to buy him, maybe you shouldn't make him? how about making a lex luthor action figure true to the tweed suit wearing gene hackman of my early childhood? now that is an action figure i could get behind. i left parasite in the packaging on the floor over in the corner for awhile, but eventually pulled him out so i could break down the boxes (god, so many boxes, and don't get me started on the plastic and the peanuts. stop shipping stuff in peanuts, folks.) that's when i put him on that table near my bed, and what fortune became of him (and me) when the only person on this planet who could possibly like parasite walked into my bedroom, saw him and said, "heeeey, can i have that for my birthday?"

"yes."

"really? i was kidding, but really?"

"happy birthday."

"thanks!"

and then i didn't have to get her a birthday present. that was one of the more interesting exchanges i've had. 

despite my dislike of parasite, there are villains i do like, and gentleman ghost is one of them.

somewhere along the way, getting batman that first day (the black suit batman, not even the superfriends batman) turned into me getting all of the superfriends action figures, just like his.

his collection has been about staying alive.

my collection has been about us.

when he showed me gentleman ghost, a villain with a bit part in superfriends and not really on the cast of characters for the show, i wanted him. i legitimately, genuinely wanted that toy. his legs are invisible (okay, we exaggerate, but in the universe of toys, his legs are invisible), and he's all white, otherwise, and he's got no head. i had seen him on a picture of all of the toys together that j showed me before i started buying them. he showed it to me and said i should get the one i like best. there was gentleman ghost looking really cool, but i didn't even know who he was and i was only going to just get one anyway, so i went with batman.

but gentleman ghost would be had. and i got him. i looked so forward to getting this package in the mail. 

![gentleman ghost]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/gg.jpg)

he came with hawkgirl, who is also very cool, but she can't stand up, which is, you know, a let down. i still love her though. those wings.

bizarro, not exciting, but i do like his nail polish. i find that i'm not as interested in the toys who have bad grammar. solomon grundy and gorilla grodd can get fucked for all i care. but i'll still get them, and i'll be happy to have them in my collection.

i really like that i have batman and robin, but somehow feel sort of indifferent to them on the love/hate scale. i don't think they're on that scale. they're just batman and robin. holy 4th dimension, batman.

there's black manta, who is actually blue, and he's incredible. he's wearing a rubbery, alien body suit. literally. (sort of literally.)

and even though aquaman is the most useless superhero of all time, i really love his action figure. both of them, because i have two, one at home and one at the office. i play with the one at the office more than i play with any of my other figures. he's easy to pose, and he just looks cool.

but if you really want to know my favorite action figure, it isn't hawkman (he's close though, very close).

and it isn't superman.

no, i have to go with the fingers. 

the most expensive toy of them all. 

i really, really fucking love dr. fate.

![dr fate]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/fate.jpg)

those fingers. and the rest of him too, but those fingers.

j's picture of dr. fate is far better than mine. most of his pictures are better than mine. i'm new to this "fun" business. i'm learning. tomorrow i get toyman and el dorado. i have a feeling el dorado will be a favorite, even though toyman has fingers.

i am eager to collect each one, to share the experience with j, and when i have them all, to find something new that he and i can enjoy together. i am a 35 year old woman with a life full of superfriends.
