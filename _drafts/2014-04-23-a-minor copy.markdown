**her**<br>
Pardon me for sending you a message from so very far away, but...
*I’m going to love you; I just don't know it yet.*

**them**<br>
"This is the most I've corresponded in a very long time," he said to her.

"You should correspond more," her words were lazy but thoughtful. "It's human in an inhuman world."

"I can only manage it with a very rare breed. You'd have to be around all the time, and I'm sure I'd be imposing on your time."

**him**<br>
I'm glad you're here, still. I'm thinking many things about you right now.

**them**<br>
They had already known each other for months, but somehow, this night, they truly met. 

"...which is ironic, as I'm as rebellious as they come." She always had a way of talking about serious matters in an offhanded, nonchalant way.

"I really, really want you to be." His response stopped her. Made her think about her next words.

"It's a quiet rebellion. Most people aren't worth the energy."

"You're right, and your rebellions are worth their weight in gold. I get that sense. Strongly."

"I suppose I can pack away the nagging thought that you're someone I grew up with."

"How do you know?"

"He was younger than me, by a year or so. And he grew up in Kansas too. You would be a fantastic liar if you were him."

"I'm two months older than you. We didn't grow up together. And I'm glad, because I could never have appreciated the bloom of this intrigue as a younger man."

"You tease me."

"I assure you."

"I am speechless."

"But surely not wordless."

"Never. Impossible."

"Yes. We're playing the game."

"I always win."

"Hm. Isn't it pretty to think so."

"Filthy gorgeous."

"We're well suited."

**him**<br>
We might do dangerous things together, you and I. Watch out.
