There was a time, not too many years ago, when I spent one very miserable year working for a very miserable company in Seattle. I went into that job full of optimism and hope, but it didn't take long before red flags, unhappy people, company gossip, and downright concerning things started happening.

I tried my best to make the most of it. I really did. But after a year, it was time.

Shortly before I left, I was tasked with hiring a new manager for my department. I had the help of the administrative manager of our sister company, who went through the process with me as we interviewed and picked the best candidate (who was never offered the job after weeks of back and forth because the owner of the company finally decided to tell us that he never *actually* intended to hire anyone anyway. If you're wondering why that job wasn't a great job, perhaps that's a little hint.) 

What I remember most about that process, though, was sitting in the upstairs conference room looking out over the nearby ships one afternoon with a timid middle aged lady sitting across from us answering our very dull questions about her career. The admin manager focused in on a recent gap in her employment and wanted to know more about it. Her mother had passed away from cancer, she told us, obviously uncomfortable with the topic, and she decided to take some time off after being a caregiver while also working full time. She had needed a break, but was ready to rejoin the working world.

After the mousy haired lady left, I sat in the conference room with the admin manager, who told me that we couldn't hire someone who would just "quit their job after a family emergency". She went on at length about how those kind of people can't be trusted. What happens if her dad dies? Is she just going to quit and leave us hanging too? I was pretty emotionless and removed from it all. Just counting down the hours until I was free for the day and could get back to more important things than the absurdity and inauthenticity of business speak, endlessly pointless meetings, hushed laughter and whispers about who did what, and the migraine inducing flicker of industrial grade lights. But that bothered me. 

She wasn't the right person for our soon to be, jokes-on-you, nonexistent position, and it had nothing to do with the death of her mother. I could have given a list of reasons why she wasn't right (in fact, I think I did), but I didn't comment on the cancer thing that day. I couldn't bring myself to. Why fight that attitude. Why put more effort and passion into a dead end job in a miserable place that will always be cursed with unhappy people doing unhappy things. 

But it bothered me. It bothered me so much that a few years later, I sit here in Portland and remember that afternoon with an uncomfortable knot in my stomach. I don't even remember that woman's name. But I remember that she lost her mother and then was denied the opportunity for a new job based on that fact, rather than on any actual qualifications she did or didn't have.

Because that's who we are.

We are a society that plays that nonsense and abides by it.

What I couldn't know that afternoon but know better than most now is exactly what it's like to lose your mother to cancer and how that impacts the very core of your being. Your job is nothing compared to the loss of your mother. Any employer who would think otherwise cannot possibly have an ounce of empathy in them. 

My own mother didn't find out she had cancer until a year or so after that afternoon. I was sitting pretty easy back then. I had a job I hated, but my personal life was okay. I had a mother, after all.

My world began to shatter around me when she was diagnosed with stage IV primary peritoneal carcinoma. You've never even heard of such a beastly cancer, and I sincerely hope this right here is the only time you come across that name.

I left Seattle not even six months after her diagnosis. At the time, I was freelancing as a designer and getting by on the income from it. Had she not had cancer, and had I not used the freedom of being a freelancer to allow me to travel back and forth to my hometown so I could spend more time with her, then perhaps I could have pulled in more money, focused more on my projects, gotten even more clients. I don't know. Perhaps not. In the end, as each contract came to a close, I let them go, freeing up my schedule and emptying out my bank account. I just couldn't do it. I didn't enjoy it, but more importantly, I just *couldn't* keep doing it. My life was not fulfilling. That's what I learned about myself during that experience. That's what you learn about life when you start to lose someone you love. You learn what is and isn't important. 

I realized that Seattle was not important to me. I realized that it wasn't the right place for me, but I had been pretending it was, forcing it to be, telling people how much I loved it (and at times, I sincerely did), but ignoring that something wasn't right about it all.

With a dwindling income and no idea what to do with myself, I fled south to Portland to spend more time with my sister. She was important to me. She gave my life more meaning. I still had a couple small contracts to help me get by, but even those were soon coming to an end.

I wasn't happy in Portland, but at least I had my sister. I spent every single day fretting over my prospects. Applying for jobs. Trying to figure out what I would do if I couldn't find one before the money ran out. At the same time, I was a few months into a new friendship with someone very special. He and I knew immediately that we were somehow meant to be. It's one of those dreamy, romantic (at the surface) stories, but we were seperated by a great distance. I was on the west coast, he on the east. 

I applied for a job here in Portland knowing I would get it. It was my dream job, at the time, for a well known startup that I admired. I told myself that if I didn't get the job, I was going to pack up my stuff and move to the east coast. I would figure things out. But if I did get the job, I would put in my time, use it to help my career and, most importantly, do my best to sincerely enjoy the experience and contribute to the team. Maybe it would be the thing that makes me love Portland. 

The week of my last interview for that job, I sunk to my lowest misery over my situation. I came to the decision that it was time to leave Portland and start fresh, closer to the person in my life I cared most about and wanted to be with. If I wasn't going to have a job anywhere, then I might as well not have a job near him.

I decided I was going to leave on Saturday. I started stressing over letting my housemate down (she needed the extra income from my rent). I started to get excited about leaving Portland. I felt a little warmth of hope start flipping around in my chest. And then my phone rang.

Curious.

I had somehow forgotten that I'd just, two days earlier, interviewed for the job that I knew, after months of looking for a job and being turned down time and again, I was going to get.

It was them.

I got the job.

When I hung up, I sobbed. Ah, you cruel tease, life. You cruel, cruel tease.

I chose career over love and risk and family. 

I never did end up liking Portland. I hate it as much today as I did then. My job? It is a great job. I love my coworkers. I love what I have been a part of. I am good at what I do. I have made an impact and risen to the top as an example and a resource and someone that others admire and rely on. 

But I love someone dearly, now almost two years after we've met, who lives on the east coast. And my mother died from cancer. I watched her deteriorate and suffer and lose her battle, though she desperately wanted to beat it. I had the support of my company during that time. They asked very few questions. They paid me while I was away. They were the only people who gave me an actual, physical sympathy card (dear world, Facebook comments are not an acceptable form of support, but I won't write about that today), they loved me and hugged me when I came back and didn't even bat an eye when I would occasionally disappear to the bathroom or a conference room to be alone for awhile. They set up a fund for me and raised over $1000 in under a week, just because they cared. I will always be grateful for this company and the family of people I have here. 

But something happens to you when your mother dies. No matter how good your job is, no matter how much you love the people you work with, no matter how much you *need* the job you have, you discover what we already know about life but pretend we don't: life is fragile, valuable and too short to be unhappy. 

We talked about whether he should move here or I should move there. After a lot of conversations and really looking at our separate situations, we knew that the best decision for both of us is for me to join him there. 

The thought of leaving my dream job does make me sad. Of course it does. But the thought of continuing to put my personal life on hold so I can have a good career makes me unbearably unhappy. 

I started applying for new jobs not long before my mom died. I had a good reason in mind, should anyone ask in the application and interview process why I was leaving my dream job. "Well, I'd like to be closer to my family." That's legitimate, isn't it?

But now I can't use that. Now the reason is more personal. "My mom died. Don't you understand? She's dead. My life is different now than it was 3 months ago. Or 6 months ago. Or 3 years ago. I'm very good at what I do, and I will continue to be. I'm very valuable where I work, and that will never change, regardless of where I go. But I need to put *me* first, do you see? I need to make sure that I am happy, because some day I am going to die too. And when that day comes, I don't want to look back and think, 'well I had a pretty sweet gig.' No. I want to look back and remember that I worked hard to make my life fulfilling. To be with the person I care about most. That I made sacrifices I **do not regret** to be with him. My mom is gone. My family is shattered. We are going to struggle for many years to heal from this. 

He is my family now, and I need to be with my family. 

I continue to look for an elusive job. Finding a job in a city on the other coast is almost impossible. Why would they hire me? Finding a remote position is almost impossible. The competition is tough and the available spots are few. 

I interview for positions and they say I'm such a good fit, but they never offer me the job. They ask me questions that take me back to that conference room in Seattle. "Why are you wanting to leave *that* company?" They must know I'm not telling them the whole truth. How can I? 

"Because I value the quality of my life more than I value my career."

"Hmm."

"But don't you understand? It doesn't matter if I work for you for 3 months, or 6 months, or 3 years, or 10, I *will* be valuable to you. I do value my career. I have a work ethic that will surpass most of your team. If I only worked for you for 3 months, I would still be one of the best employees you've ever had. But my goal isn't to work for you for 3 months or 10 years. My goal is to find a job that will allow me to put my life first so that I can spend my years happily fulfilled while *also* contributing my best to your company." 

Why wouldn't you want that for your employees?

Maybe soon I can have the best of both.
