I admit. I've messed with our routine so much lately, I can't figure if I should be writing now or not. I wanted to tell you to have a good Thanksgiving. I imagine you're with your family and friends in Wichita. Maybe not. I guess I don't really know.
 
For all I know you won't even check if I've written for some time, from the looks of it. Doesn't bother me. I've been so busy these past few weeks anyway. Even though the distance is greater for this, I still think often of you and your daily goings-on. With your recent admission that you're presently not as interested in the internet as you have been in the past, I suppose I'll have to imagine a little harder about what you might or might not be doing with your life. In fact, I can only think to say, *good for you*.
 
I have a peaceful contentment this holiday season. My life is not as I expected, but good all the same. I have a good friend a state away, even though it becomes increasingly difficult to hear from or about him. This year was immensely better than last, and I am happy to say that I look forward to next with the anticipation and hope of a child the eve before a special day.
 
I'm glad you got the gift and on the day it was intended at that. I sincerely hope it makes you smile, the way it did for me. Or at least that it reminds you that you have a friend a state away, even though it becomes increasingly difficult to hear from or about her.
 
Have a good day. You deserve it.
