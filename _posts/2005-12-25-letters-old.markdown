I admit. I've messed with our routine so much lately, I can't figure if I should be writing now or not. I wanted to tell you to have a good Thanksgiving. I imagine you're with your family and friends in Wichita. Maybe not. I guess I don't really know.
 
For all I know you won't even check if I've written for some time, from the looks of it. I've been so busy these past few weeks anyway. Even though the distance is greater for this, I still think often of you and your daily goings-on. I suppose I'll have to imagine a little harder about what you might or might not be doing with your life. In fact, I can only think to say, *good for you*.
 
I have a peaceful contentment this holiday season. My life is not as I expected, but good all the same. I have a good friend a state away, even though it becomes increasingly difficult to hear from or about him. This year was better than last, and I am happy to say that I look forward to next with the anticipation and hope of a child on the eve before a special day.
 
I'm glad you got the gift and on the day it was intended. I sincerely hope it makes you smile, the way it did for me. Or at least that it reminds you that you have a friend a state away, even though it becomes increasingly difficult to hear from or about her.
