We moved into a new office a couple weeks ago and my commute to and from work has become somewhat more hellish. In our previous office, it took me 40 minutes, tops, to get home by train. Now it takes me an entire hour, sometimes a few minutes over.

This wouldn't be a problem except I only have one hour to get home before I'm needed back at work again. I travel on my lunch break so I can work from home the rest of my day. This is for safety reasons. You don't want to be a gal walking around this town alone after dark, and I work for a 24/7 company, so I often work those late hours.

Last Friday, I hopped on the train shortly after 7pm, and then it turned down the wrong tracks and wouldn't let us off. We had a train full of people pushing the call button trying to get the driver's attention to find out why exactly the yellow train was going down the green line. She finally responded to tell us a supervisor was going to come talk to us at the next stop. 

No, no. We don't need to talk to a supervisor. We need off this train that's taking us farther away from where we were trying to get. The train doors finally opened and a group of us strangers now bonded by a public transportation mishap bolted out the doors and booked it as fast as we could several city blocks *back* to where the nearest yellow line platform was. I don't know about the other passengers, but I had to be home by 8pm and back online again. I'm no good as a manager if I'm not there managing my crew.

After taking the next yellow train that showed up, I had to run the last stretch home, which is usually a pleasant walk, and I put key to my front door at 8:03pm, by some miracle.

Amazingly, my new office is only one stop further from my old office. It's inexplicable how this adds 20 minutes to my commute, and yet, every day I face this new problem. It's beginning to wear me down. 

Tonight the train was 10 minutes late, packed full, smelled funny, and I've been noticing that the clickity-clack on the tracks is becoming distintcly more of a continuous pound and jolt that makes my head hurt. I don't remember it ever being such a rough ride before.

But something happened tonight. The driver got on the intercom and apologized for being so late, then told us why she had been running late. The tracks were blocked several stops back. I had no idea. 

The train was still packed full and smelled funny, I was still in a rush to get home on time, and my neck was sore from the jerking motion of the train, but my bad attitude immediately dissipated with an, "Oh. That's an acceptable excuse to be 10 minutes late."

Authenticity and courtesy are two of the strongest tools we have in our pocket when we work in any type of customer service position, as I currently do. I've always had a way with the upset customers, and when people ask me what my secret is, I tell them it's no secret at all. When someone is upset, they want to be heard (courtesy), and they want to understand (authenticity).
