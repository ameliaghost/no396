**The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword Link Figma Action Figure**
<br/>*a review*

My earliest memories of Link are of watching my older brother play *Zelda II: The Adventure of Link* on the original Nintendo. I would sometimes play as well, but I was lousy at it; let’s be honest. I never fully understood who Zelda was or what she had to do with the game. All I knew at the time was that it was a *totally radical* game, mostly because my brother said so, and I knew who the cool kids were (my brother).

Seeing a screenshot from that game immediately takes me back to my early childhood, and the 8 bit theme music is as clear in my mind now as if I’m actually listening to it. You know what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vUmtUBHto" target="_blank">I’m talking about.</a>

I put 80 hours of my life a few weeks ago into playing *The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword*, and despite loving most every moment of this game save for the Moldarach I can’t think of any of the music from it. This should be an indication of how influential *The Adventure of Link* was in my early years.

Having said that, I never really knew the story. Like most people, I got Zelda and Link confused, and then I never played another Zelda game again until I picked up *Skyward Sword*. In *Skyward Sword*, Zelda is a childhood friend of Link’s. They attend the same school in a pretty sweet floating city that is separated from the rest of their world and ignorant about their history. When Zelda mysteriously disappears, Link sets off on a mission to find her, discovering his own destiny and how to play a magical harp along the way, but enough about how little I actually know about the history of Link aside from old pixelated memories and this one new storyline. 

I started collecting action figures a year ago, and I only just figured out how to make them stand up without falling over, so my review of Link may not be your standard review on articulation, history and comparisons that other collectors or reviewers would expect. *He's bendy and he has a lot of parts.* That's my unofficial non-reviewer's review.

I bought The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword Link Figma Action Figure after a friend said I should, claiming it was one of the most unique and fun figures he’d ever purchased. Before I even got it out of the box (yeah, get your action figures out of their boxes; what fun are they all wrapped up in plastic?) I had at least three people call him Zelda, including the very same brother that hogged the NES when we were kids.

Well, no, he’s not Zelda. He’s a little harp-playing, sword-wielding, rupee-finding, skyward strike-posing, kickass pre-teen, and this action figure feels more real than toy. This is the kind of toy that just actually might come to life when you aren't paying attention to it.

Look. This is the first picture I took of him:

See what I’m saying? I mean, sure, I added a couple filters from some app or another on my phone, but otherwise, *that* is this toy. If not for the lines and gaps of the joints, you might not even realize you're looking at an action figure.

That's what is so great about this Link.

Let's rewind a minute back to *I only just figured out how to make them stand up without falling over*. This is a truth I am willing to admit to help you understand one of the reasons why this figure is so great.

You might not realize how difficult it is to get an action figure to stand up. If you grew up playing with them perhaps it comes more naturally to you, but I grew up playing with My Little Pony, known for their four very solid, thick feet. Getting a toy to stand up wasn't a problem I ever encountered before.

Case in point, The Black Series Boba Fett. He's back heavy, so to get him to stand up at all, I would have to hunch him over leaning forward, making him look a bit more geriatric than we know he ever got to be (or *do* we?)

As soon as I would try to straighten his body, this would happen *every* time:

So I had to make the most of my abilities and let him be.

As mentioned, I have since learned the trick to action figure center of gravity. I'm still working it out but am much better than I was before. Boba Fett is currently flat on his back, but this time it's the cat's fault. Honest.

The reason I bring this up is because it wasn't until months later that I realized I never had these balance and gravity problems with Link. He is so flexible and easy to manipulate that standing him up is intuitive. I stood him on a rounded knob above a massive staircase down a steep hill. It took a couple seconds, and I never worried that he would topple over.

Had that been Boba Fett, he would have tumbled down those stairs the way he fell into the hungry jaws of the Sarlacc — awkward and clumsy.

The fact that I live in Ferngully certainly helps Link look like an impressive figure.

But he still impresses without the forest backdrop.

More about that forest though.

One of the details about Link that most contributes to how good he looks is something that doesn't immediately stand out at all. It's the way his clothes were subtly sculpted to look natural, showing the wrinkles of movement. He's made of a very smooth plastic, and he fits in my hand comfortably. His joints move with a fluidity that feels natural. Which is another point. Most action figures have to be forced into a pose that looks natural. Link just glides into it without any effort. You have to force him to not look natural.

If you buy some of the nicer action figures out of Japan, you'll get a figure with interchangeable features, such as more than one facial expression, more than one hair style (options seem to be: normal or blowing-in-the-wind), and several hands to choose from. I love this about Link, but at the same time fiddling with the small pieces for a few minutes to change the way he looks can be, for me at least, a little overwhelming. Every time I put new hands on him, I have to double check that his thumbs are in the right places. There is a tiny end cap for the hilt of his sword. It's smaller than the back of an earring and is lost just as quickly and easily if you drop it. You will drop it. It's nice to know I have all of these options though.

I told my friend that he should get a second Link, so he could keep one on his desk at work. He did end up getting a second one, but I realize now that I was talking to myself. I need a second Link for *my* desk at work. He's a fine little figure, the kind you don't want to pose and leave alone. He's the kind you can't help but to keep messing with and re-posing.

Link is actually *fun* to own because of how poseable he is.

Pros: Easy to pose and very dynamic. He looks just like his character from the game. Of all of the action figures I own, the pictures I take of him somehow always turn out the best with the least amount of effort.

Cons: The sword is sharp. I actually managed to stab myself and draw blood with it once. The two handles on the shield aren't a great fit with his hands, in my opinion. It isn't easy to get him to hold onto the shield firmly. The smaller pieces are easy to lose.

If I can make an action figure sit naturally in under 30 seconds, then I can confidently say this is a good figure to own, especially for people like me who struggle from a certain pose defiency.

I am glad I took my friend's advice and bought Link. He is easily one of my favorite action figures. He looks good. He's easy to handle. He's true to the charater from the game. And he has a way of sparking imagination where other figures often don't. This is not a figure to put on display and forget about. This is a figure meant for play.
