Devastation isn’t such a bad thing. It’s winter. It’s after winter when the snow starts to melt and there are little bulbs of purple and yellow on green, pushing through the dirty white. It’s a fire over the soil so crops grow stronger, later. It’s redemption after the long burn.

Yesterday I sat on Love for the first time, and I realized why it is I always choose to sit on Loss. Loss is easy. Love is a little uncomfortable and covered in bird feces.
