Recently the oldest brother told me something in reference to a little joke I made at my own expense. He said *that happens to most everyone else. Don't let it happen to you.* You see, I had drawn up an alternate plan for my life, as follows: 

A. Work. <br/>
B. Pay off debt and start saving.<br/>
C. Begin licensure.<br/>
D. Get bogged down in the daily run of life and forget dreams. 

You're probably wondering what the real plan is, that being the alternate.

If your friend is smart, she'll keep you around. Most relationships fail anyway; she's lucky to have you for what you *aren't*. 

My favorite kind of piano music is when a simple melody is played, repeated and occasionally embellished. It gives the silence between the notes so much unexpected power and passion. There would be no rhythm if not for the silence. It's a lesson I taught every one of my students. Hopefully one day it will stick with them. My first listen to this album I immediately associated with the optimistic quality. It feels promising, reminiscent of those good, sunny days when everything is perfect and you can't help but smile a genuine smile. The second time through it broke me as much as music can. And music can. How did something so joyful an hour before become so intensely sad? It has evened out now, and I am left somewhere between the two but still feeling both extremes. 

It's morning now. I have been having trouble sleeping lately; I'm back to two or three hours and a nap if I'm lucky. I'm going to take the dog for a long walk and talk to myself about Australia.
