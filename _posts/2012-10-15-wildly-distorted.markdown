I don't remember where I picked this book up, but after having spent a couple years living in Sydney, my interest was piqued and I found an enjoyable and nostalgic read in *30 Days in Sydney: A Wildly Distorted Account*. Peter Carey displays careful mixture of adoration and repulsion for Sydney. At first, I admit I was bothered by the negative bent he had towards Sydney, but I gradually came to realize that it was an honest and unflinching account of his view of this city. If I have to be honest myself, I’d say that for as much as I love Sydney, there really are many aspects that annoy me, though I'm always hesitant to focus on them. Carey says it in a way that feels not too unlike siblings defending each other against bullies: “*I’m* the only one who gets to call her that.” It’s a privilege earned by being subjected to some of the unflattering quirks of a place while understanding why those quirks exist.

Sydney is a maddening, frustrating, beautiful, enchanting place. This book feels like a letter to a friend, any friend at all, who knows Sydney. If you ever wanted to understand why Sydney continues to hold hostage my emotions and dreams, even long after I left her, reading this book would be a good place to start — though I don’t know how well it would be received by someone not familiar with the place, the people, the history or the customs.

Everything about how Carey describes Sydney in this book touched me. He details what anyone familiar with Sydney knows – Mr. Eternity, taking the ferry to Manly, the Bondi to Coogee walk, visiting the Blue Mountains, Parramatta Rd, the Hawkesbury River and Barrenjoey, the astounding beauty of Sydney: *“This was the great joy of Sydney, that you could have THIS…”*, the unfortunate configuration of the Cahill Expressway, the great towering mammoth that is the Harbour Bridge. 

But then he also writes of places that felt like they were a special, personal touch just for me. He describes going to a lecture at Sydney University in the faculty of architecture. In this description, he finds himself in a room I have sat in countless times myself. At the end he *“slink[s] out of the lecture theatre, out into the dark rainy streets of City Road”*. That’s all he has to write and I’m back in Darlington after a long day, slinking my own way out of Wilkinson only to find that City Road is dark and rainy, the glint of streetlights sparkling off the wet pavement, the rain freshening the air and cleaning the neighborhood of that particular stench caused by the Australian urban heat.

It never stops raining in Sydney, after all, but truthfully, when it does, there is no other place on earth that can compare. *“This is what my Sydney friends could do each morning. They were never blind to where they were but they never stopped bantering, heckling, joking.”* 

Sydney, you were a fine home for me during my brief two years there, one I will remember with fondness, defend against the bullies, and pack away those memories, good and bad, of a unique and distorted place.
