Every screen erupted with the exciting, unexpected news. 

I sat alone in a coffee shop in NoPo, condensation heavy on the windows, the churning sound from the barista fixing other peoples’ espressos and the melody of a sad musician playing softly over the scrapes, taps and scratches of the few customers seated comfortably around the room while each new article was released from media hubs around the world. The New York Times, Gizmodo, TechCrunch, Reuters, 

*(the Reuters guy — I recognized his name immediately. “I know that guy.” Jacob said to me once as we fixed tea in the kitchen while listening to the news. “Oh? How do you know him?” “He wrote about me once, a few years ago.” “Oh, huh.”)*

Mashable, Financial Times, The Verge, The New York Observer, Wired, The New Yorker,

*(that was a good one, The New Yorker. I kind of liked it.)*

The Economist, The New York Observer, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Sacramento Bee, and countless other Business Journals around the world. Twitter and Facebook played along too as an endless stream of information flickered across my screen, distracting me from the work I should have been doing. Instead I clicked every article. I read each one, sometimes twice, or three times, or five. My eyes traced the lines and curves of the words written on the screen as my thoughts lingered on what people were saying and thinking. Journalists and bloggers rushed to be the first, most accurate and most visible to report the news that day. As I sat in that little cold coffee shop, I read news I already knew. I had known for a while. Each and every article I read was a kick to my fragile, healing heart and brought fresh tears to eyes I thought I'd dried.

That was the day the public learned about Jacob’s acquisition. The one that broke my heart.

I was the Two Hundred Million Dollar Breakup Startup Sweetheart.
