I haven't yet learned how to write a lifetime of love and a season of agony into a few brief sentences. I've been trying for some time to push through this block and tell the story I need to tell. There's too much emotion, too many memories, not enough time or clarity and an ache too deep to yet define.

It was my mother's home, you see, and so it was mine where she would always be.

As born to rule the storm;*</font>

Like the boy in *Casabianca*, I stand at my post and watch the storm around me in what was once a safe port.
