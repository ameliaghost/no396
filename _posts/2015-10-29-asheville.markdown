While flipping through an antique book I recently bought on a whim, I came across a poem called Casabianca where poet Felicia Hemans tells the tale of a boy who wouldn't leave his post on his father's ship, though it was being destroyed in the chaos and ruin of battle all around him. He stood there eager and prepared to fight, waiting for his father to give him his orders. 

*Yet beautiful and bright he stood,*<br/>
  *As born to rule the storm;*<br/>

Those two lines, more than any other in recent memory, grabbed my emotions and pulled. Hard.

I didn't know the story of Casabianca and the Battle of the Nile before reading this, though it turns out that this poem was taught extensively in European and American schools for many generations before mine.

The boy died. 

I'll give away the ending right here and now. He called to his father several times, asking permission to leave his post and join the fight, but his father never responded because he had already been killed. 

It was the fighting spirit the boy had juxtaposed against his firm obedience in certain death that was relatable and, ultimately, emotional for me. I can't say I've ever been in a French battle with ships and cannonballs, but the year I've had... Well.

I lost my mother to cancer not even five months ago. Her dying act, her final wish, knowing that she only had days to live, was to pay off her house. She was very intentional about it, and she hung on until she got the letter in the mail. I watched her that afternoon as she opened the envelope with urgency and then sighed, smiled and looked at me. I want to remember what she said. There are all of these little details that maybe don't matter very much but that I try desperately to remember. She may have said, "I did it." Or "Look at this." Or "I was hoping this would get here." Or "The house is paid off."

That may have been it. That sounds like something she would say, so humbly. "The house is paid off."

There was a social worker there in the living room with us that afternoon. I don't remember her name, but I do remmeber that she was tall and had brown hair and carried a thick three ring binder, and she talked to us about burial and cremation. I wanted to tell her to stop talking about it in front of my mom because she was still alive. I couldn't cope with that conversation knowing that she had days left with us. You should not know when you're going to die. It's a cruelty in an already devastating situation.

I wanted to know what my mom was thinking about, but I was afraid to ask her. I never did ask her. I would sometimes I ask her if she was afraid, but I wouldn't ever say, "do you want to talk about *your* death?"

We were talking about the funeral preparations, or rather she, the social worker, was talking about funeral preparations. She was doing her job. She had several brochures and no empathy and handled it with a suave and inhumane detachment. I would rate her poorly if given the chance. While she was selling the death experience to us with her brochures, I was sitting on the sofa, my anxiety higher than I've ever known it to be, and mom was sitting on the hospice bed that she would die on two weeks later, the bed that would be carted away by some guy in a truck to the next home where someone was going to die soon too. She must not have been paying much attention to the social worker. Maybe that's what she was thinking about â€” how to not pay attention to everyone telling her she was going to die very soon but that's okay because death is very natural and you have to read brochures about it and accept that your family is already grieving your death even though you're sitting *right* here and alive.

Mom put the brochures aside and held up the envelope for the social worker to see. "The house is paid off. This just came today."

The social worker didn't care. But I cared. I was watching her closely, as I would for three horrible weeks, and I cared. 

What I didn't do was understand. She didn't tell me the importance of that act, of her paying off the house right before she died, or why she had waited until the letter came in the mail before she could finally let go of this life and begin the dying process, which she did a few hours later.

I assumed she had done it because she wanted to ensure that when my father passed away, the house would be ours to sell and split among us. A small inheritence. Her dying gift for her children.
