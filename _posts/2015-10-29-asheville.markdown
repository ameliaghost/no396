While flipping through an antique book I recently bought on a whim, I came across a poem called Casabianca where poet Felicia Hemans tells the tale of a boy who wouldn't leave his post on his father's ship, though it was being destroyed in the chaos and ruin of battle all around him. He stood there eager and prepared to fight, waiting for his father to give him his orders. 

*Yet beautiful and bright he stood,*<br/>
  *As born to rule the storm;*<br/>

Those two lines, more than any other in recent memory, grabbed my emotions and pulled. Hard.
