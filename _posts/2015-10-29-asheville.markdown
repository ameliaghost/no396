While flipping through an antique book, I came across a poem called Casabianca. In it, Felicia Hemans tells the tale of a boy who wouldn't leave his post on his father's ship, though it was being destroyed all around him. He stood there eager and prepared to fight, waiting for his father to give him his orders. 

*Yet beautiful and bright he stood,*<br/>
  *As born to rule the storm;*<br/>
