While flipping through an antique book I recently bought on a whim, I came across a poem that tells of a boy who wouldn't leave his post on a ship while it was being destroyed in the chaos and ruin of battle. He stood eager and prepared to fight, waiting for the captain, his father, to give him his orders. 

<font color="2C3539">*Yet beautiful and bright he stood,<br/>
As born to rule the storm;*</font>

The boy died. 

I'll give away the ending now. He called to his father several times, asking permission to leave his post and join the fight, but his father never responded because he had already been killed. 

I haven't yet learned how to write a lifetime of love and a season of agony into a few brief sentences. I've been trying for some time to tell the story I need to tell, but I've learned that there's too much emotion, too many memories, not enough time or clarity and an ache too deep to yet define. It may become the story I spend the rest of my life writing, in pieces.

I could easily be that young boy â€” aware of the destruction around me and eager to push back if only someone would give me permission. The danger isn't in the circumstances but in failing to do anything out of obedience or fear.

Like the boy in the poem, I stand at my post and watch the storm around me in what was once a safe port, seeking guidance from a father who is no longer responding to my cries.

2015 has been a beast of a year filled with death and unwanted change in a storm so fierce it ravaged my family and the safety we thought we had in our future. But with grace I go forward, alone if I must, because I *was* born for this. The light that breaks through the storm is always the sweetest reminder of calm to come.

I have that light in ambition, progress and love.
