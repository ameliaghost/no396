While flipping through an antique book I recently bought on a whim, I came across a poem called Casabianca where poet Felicia Hemans tells the tale of a boy who wouldn't leave his post on his father's ship, though it was being destroyed in the chaos and ruin of battle all around him. He stood there eager and prepared to fight, waiting for his father to give him his orders. 

*Yet beautiful and bright he stood,*<br/>
  *As born to rule the storm;*<br/>

Those two lines, more than any other in recent memory, grabbed my emotions and pulled. Hard.

I didn't know the story of Casabianca before reading this, though it turns out that this poem was taught extensively in European and American schools for many generations before mine.

The boy died. I'll give away the ending right here and now. He called to his father several times, asking permission to leave his post and join the fight, but his father never responded because he was already dead. 

It was the fighting spirit the boy had juxtaposed against his firm obedience in certain death that was instantly relatable to me.

Let me tell you about the week I've had.
