While flipping through an antique book, a recent impulse buy from Etsy, I came across a poem called Casabianca. In it, Felicia Hemans tells the tale of a boy who wouldn't leave his post on father's ship, though it was being destroyed all around him. He stood there eager and prepared to fight, waiting for his father to give him his orders. 

*Yet beautiful and bright he stood,*<br/>
  *As born to rule the storm;*<br/>




I can stand at my post where I'm expected to stay, watching even as I know that everything around me is falling away and to stay is the more dangerous option, or I can go with my intuition, that inner wisdom that has led me thus far without fail, and take the risk I know I must take.
