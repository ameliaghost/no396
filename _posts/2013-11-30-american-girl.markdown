Life is a project.

I’m thinking of becoming an alcoholic. Or a smoker. (No, I’m not.)

I’m thinking of getting a retail job just so I can meet people and smile at them and listen to their boring stories, which are actually kind of fascinating.

I’m thinking of reading all those David Mitchell books that have been sitting on my shelf for years.

I’m thinking of driving down to Portland and sleeping on my sister’s sofa for a week or two or three, working in coffee shops down there for a week or two or three, getting to know her roommates better for a week or two maybe three.

I’m thinking of running 3 miles on Thursday and 3.25 miles on Friday and 5 miles in two weeks and a half marathon by Christmas.

I’m thinking of finding a bar I like in Ballard and going there, alone, and sitting there, alone, and ordering myself a whiskey ginger and seeing what happens.

I’m thinking of calling that charming Irishman on the Eastside and asking just exactly what it is he’s doing with all my things that he won’t return to me.

I’m thinking of finally taking that first aid class I’ve been wanting to take for two months.

I’m thinking of movement, any kind of movement, forward motion. Brownian.

°°°

I’m going to let you in on a little secret.

Herkimer and Stumptown are great. So is Dunkin’ Donuts. My midwestern days don’t begin until I have an iced black from Dunkin’ Donuts. Good coffee is sparse out here.

$2.27 for a medium. I never add cream or sugar. Why would I do that? If I weren’t on a quest to eat all the mac and cheese, I’d quit eating altogether and probably just drink coffee and I’d be happy. (That’s not true, but it nearly is.) I’m on my second Dunkin’ today. I’m under the impression they also have donuts at that place. I wouldn’t know, though, as I’ve never had one. You will never hear me say this about any other fast food joint, but I wouldn’t complain if I saw a Dunkin’ Donuts going up in Ballard.



I’m wearing this awful mismatched outfit, my hair is tattered ribbons, my winter skin is on full display and unsightly, and I’m headed into Hy-Vee to get macaroni just so I can write a post even though I have nothing to say. 

Part of me wants to wait to write this because my little genius nephew is on his way over and he’ll give me enough material to have my trusty small audience in stitches and tears. He’s a riot. Everyone thinks their kids are the cutest and smartest, so what makes mine special? Well, he’s probably not the cutest anymore. He’s finally hit that awkward pre-puberty age where he’s just, well, awkward. I’ll say it. The kid is awkward. But he is a genius. Certifiable, verified, state stamped and approved, this kid is smarter than all the other kids and probably smarter than you and me too. When he was in kindergarten, he tested out of the school tests. So they sent in the state and he tested out of their tests, so they sent in some other group of ‘he’s probably autistic so we better test him for that too’ testers. He’s not autistic, and he tested right on up to college level, and they only stopped at that level because that’s as high as it went. He tested out of the highest test of all the testers they sent to test this little weird and funny wonder child. A 5 year old with a 19 year old brain and the dry wit and ability to say it how he sees it, how it is. You have to watch yourself around him. I’m glad I’m his aunt and he adores me. I’m glad he’s on my side. I wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of anything he thinks or says if he didn’t like me. Not that he’s that type of person, he’s not, but he definitely doesn’t have a filter on honesty. You get used to it.

Inside Hy-Vee, I’m keeping an eye out for people I know. There may actually be 2.some Million people in this city, but it never fails that I run into people I know when I’m decidedly not looking my best. I do know that one of the managers of this particular store is someone I grew up with, so I keep an eye out to avoid. I get my mac and cheese (“small, please”), I rush back to my mom’s car (I kind of hope I get it in her will, but it’s a toss up between me and my brother who has four kids. These are conversations we have now, as if it’s totally normal to sit around the table and talk about who gets her car when she dies. I asked for the quilts today and she acted surprised. I asked why she acted surprised. She said she just was. Her mom and her grandma made them. Why wouldn’t I want them? I get all the wedding rings, the quilts and if I’m lucky, I might get a car. My sister gets the iPad and the vintage jewelry. My other brother gets the mortgage. What strange conversations we have when we eat lunch these days.) Then I head over to Dunkin’ Donuts to get my medium iced black. $2.27. If I give them two pennies and a dollar, I get three quarters back for laundry, later, when I’m back home in Seattle.
