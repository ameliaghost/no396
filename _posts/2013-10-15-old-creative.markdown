<span style="color:#97d700">the end</span>

His voice was gentle but urgent. I could hear the fear in it. That's what woke me up; that's what I remember most about the way he said my name. I had fallen asleep. That was the plan, to fall asleep. After three weeks of trying so desperately to stay awake, on this one night I fell asleep. As soon as he said my name I shot awake, tangled in and frustrated by my quilt as I struggled to pull it off of me while the rest of his sentence echoed so loudly in my mind that it rings there to this day.

*I think your mom is dead.*

He kept talking but I wasn't hearing him anymore. I was hearing what he had already said. *I think your mom is dead. I think your mom is dead. I think your mom is...*

*"No!"* My cry came from deep within as I gave up struggling with the quilt and instead rolled my body out of the bed, hit the floor with a thud and a knock to my knees, stood, the quilt falling to my feet, and ran past my dad, down the hallway, not minding the seven stairs, and into the living room where she was.

"This is the most I've corresponded in a very long time," he said to her.

"You should correspond more," her words were lazy but thoughtful. "It's human in an inhuman world."

"I can only manage it with a very rare breed. You'd have to be around all the time, and I'm sure I'd be imposing on your time."

*They had already known each other for months, but somehow, this night, they truly met.*

"...which is ironic, as I'm as rebellious as they come." She always had a way of talking about serious matters that was offhanded and nonchalant.

"I really, really want you to be." 

His response stopped her. Made her think about her next words.

"It's a quiet rebellion. Most people aren't worth the energy."

"You're right, and your rebellions are worth their weight in gold. I get that sense. Strongly."

"I suppose I can pack away the nagging thought that you're someone I grew up with."

"How do you know?"

"He was younger than me, by a year or so. And he grew up in Kansas too. You would be a fantastic liar if you were him."

"I'm two months older than you. We didn't grow up together. And I'm glad because I could never have appreciated the bloom of this intrigue as a younger man."

"You tease me."

"I assure you."

"I am speechless."

"But surely not wordless."

"Never. Impossible."

"Yes. We're playing the game."

"I always win."

"Hm. Isn't it pretty to think so*."

"Filthy gorgeous."

"We're well suited. We might do dangerous things together, you and I."

<span style="color:#97d700">mercurial</span>

mercurial, the fiend within that marauds your heavy soul. of hope and dreams, fragilities, tattered, you've lost control. feelings lost, despair fights forth and gambles with these days. each moment's burden, empty dark, betrayal, self malaise. the thief steals, the earth reels, your blood crawls and heart kneels. come a cure, mercurial.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">rubble and ruin</span>


I found something in all the rubble and ruin. I found purpose, connection and a lost long love quietly waiting for me while I made my mistakes.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">ghost</span>

In all of my pain and confusion, I latched onto a glinting nonpareil. A ghost who had previously latched onto me during his dark and weary confusion. We could never hurt the other. It would be unthinkable. He may not be a physical presence, but he has become my rock.

He haunts me, my ghost. He is with me every moment, and I have spent all these months willing him back to this life, back to the living. I will him to me, in the flesh, as a man I could love, as a man I would love if only he were here. It’s all I can do to stay sane, to move forward each day, to survive this painful prison. I do have a love for my ghost. I love him dearly, and he knows it. He’s the only man in my life, in all my tales and heartbreaks, who has treated me the way I deserve to be treated. An astonishing feat for a man who is not even here.

"Did you hear the voices talking in the background on that *Ave Maria* video I made?"

*I did. Thought maybe it was just me.*

"No. We both heard them. I was sitting alone in the living room at the piano. There were no tvs or radios or computers on. Interesting, isn’t it?"

*Weird.*

"I’ve listened to it a dozen times trying to figure out what it is."

*Couldn’t tell you what to make of that.*

"I don’t believe in ghosts. Just wondering what caused that sound."

*You do so believe in ghosts.*

<span style="color:#97d700">real</span>


It's going to feel more real when I hand my keys over and realize I have nothing to replace them.

It feels more real when he stands above me, puts his hands on each of my ears, leans down and kisses my forehead through the dirty strands of my unkempt morning hair.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">last tea</span>

We got together one last time for tea before my move. As we hugged and said our goodbyes, he said to me in that street accent he sometimes lets out when he's off guard or bulking up above his emotions, "*Hey!* Hey, let's get tea before you go."

You know we will.

<span style="color:#97d700">pi duplicities</span>

He smoked the last cigarette then fled to LA to detox. "Just for a few days," he said as he kissed my cheek at the airport. His stubble was a couple days out, coarse. A brief touch that was visceral. Lingering.

I drove back to his place, alone, where the cats greeted me with their sad cries. I shouldn't have bought him that pack of American Spirit.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">tertiary need</span>

He detoxed. He came back. He relapsed as he smoked into the new year. That swirl in the air and burn in my body.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">delta</span>

But the thing of it was, as we were exiting the plane, she stood up there and actually said “bye-bye” to the air between each passenger.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">the knows</span>

"Did you like the movie?" He asked me as the credits started.

"Yeah. I did. I didn't think I would, but I did." How did I not watch it 20 years ago when it was huge?

"Yeah, it's a pretty good movie." He was in the kitchen, cooking. He loves to cook. I was sitting on the sofa, wondering what movie to start next. "The director is a douche though."

"Is he?" I asked, only partially present in the conversation.

"Yeah. He is."

"Wait a minute." I stopped. Looked up. Looked right at him across the loft. Present and fully aware, our dialogue quickly replaying in my mind. He stopped too. Looked across the room to me. I knew he knew what I was about to say. I saw the subtle but pregnant amusement on his face. "How do *you* know he's a douche?"

"He just is."

"Do you know him?"

"Eh, not really." He lowered his gaze and the knife to the board as he got back to the food. "I just know he's a douche."

"Mhmm." I didn't believe him, not really.

He chopped a few vegetables, let the silence roll between us for an appropriate amount of time, then, "I almost bought his house in Brooklyn... but he was a douche."

"Is there anyone you don't know?"

"Lots."

J,

We’re all a little crazy. Some of us better at it than others.

Life is a project.

I’m thinking of becoming an alcoholic. Or a smoker. (No, I’m not.)

I’m thinking of getting a retail job just so I can meet people and smile at them and listen to their boring stories, which are actually kind of fascinating.

I’m thinking of reading all those David Mitchell books that have been sitting on my shelf for years.

I’m thinking of calling that charming Irishman on the Eastside and asking just exactly what it is he’s doing with all my things that he won’t return to me.

I’m thinking of movement, any kind of movement, forward motion. Brownian.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">truth</span>

I consider heartbroken a success. Maybe not a triumphant one, but one that proves I’ve lived.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">the fall</span>


Every time she gets quiet, every time she closes her eyes, my heart snags and a quick and trembling fear sets in saying *she died.* I check on her. I make sure she’s breathing. I look to see that her chest is moving. Of course she’s breathing. She isn’t just going to stop breathing one moment and peacefully be gone. Cancer takes awhile. It won't be peaceful. But it isn’t an irrational fear.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">redemption</span>

Devastation isn’t such a bad thing. It’s winter. It’s after winter when the snow starts to melt and there are little bulbs of purple and yellow on green, pushing through the dirty white. It’s a fire over the soil so crops grow stronger, later. It’s redemption after the long burn.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">amelia's adventures in wonderland</span>

It was a nice night, a necessary segue back into the land of the living and breathing and moving. Back up the rabbit hole after an October wrought with emotions revolving around the looming, impending, terrifying, soul-crushing death of her very favorite and only mother. The cancer is so calm, the eye of the storm, and everything swirling around it is chaos, confused and broken. Her thoughts and emotions are heightened and untrustworthy.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">love & loss</span>

Yesterday I sat on Love for the first time, and I realized why it is I always choose to sit on Loss. Loss is easy. Love is a little uncomfortable and covered in bird feces.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">broadway</span>

“You don’t do drama,” She said. “But your emotions run deep.”

“They do.”

“When I was talking to you the other night about your mom, your words were saying one thing but your eyes were saying another. You’re losing someone you love and you’re looking for a replacement. When your mom dies, who do you have? You’re losing love."

“I guess, but it isn’t because my mom is dying. It’s just a little bit louder this year.”

“Your decibel level is as loud as mine lately.” She is the loudest person I know. When she laughs in the midwest, I can almost hear it in the Pacific Northwest. She told me once she laughed so loud Andrew Bird looked up from what he was doing.

“Maybe it’s loud because I feel like I’m getting close.”

“I hope so.”

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">bang bang</span>

I half expect him to text me because it’s been 23 hours since we last talked. He’s not texting me. I’m banking my hopes and emotions on the wrong half of things today. But maybe I don’t want him to text me. What have I got to say? Nothing. Nothing new under this here Seattle sun.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">reiki</span>

I went in feeling somewhere around seventy percent, and after an hour on his table, I walked away at ninety. Not only did I physically feel better, but for the first time in days, I felt like my body was mine again.

After going through what I went through, after being so clearly aware of losing my physical self, it had been a terrible struggle to feel “whole” again, to feel grounded, but with his help, I felt like me. I felt settled. I felt normal, even. I felt good. I hurt still; my ribs were sore, my back was sore, my chest was sore, my throat was sore, every breath had a wheeze and a rattle, my head had been pounding for days, but I felt good. I felt my body repairing itself. He gave me reason to trust in my body, to have faith in my body, to revel in the wonder that is my body, that after what it went through, it was fixing itself, it was protecting me, it was strong, it was me.

<hr>

<span style="color:#97d700">irish</span>

I talked at him for two hours that night, like a kid. He humored me all along. I knew he was busy, but I was bored and he was there, online, his little green light a beacon for my own entertainment. He wouldn't have been available if he was that bothered by me. 
“Elegiac is a nice word, don’t you think? Do you read classics? What’s your favorite? Or do you just read sci-fi?”

“What, *Midwich Cuckoos* isn’t a classic?” I imagined a smirk, a twinkle in those eyes, his raised Irish inflection.

“Lemme check. Mmmm. Questionable, but perhaps. I’ll say yes in a Ray Bradbury sense; it’s a classic. You win this round.”

“Alright fine. Put your black dress on. Wear heels. We're going out.”
