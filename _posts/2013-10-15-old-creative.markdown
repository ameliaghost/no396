I talked at him for two hours that night, like a kid. He humored me all along. I know he’s busy, but I was bored and he was there, online, his little green light a beacon for my own entertainment. He wouldn't have been available if he was that bothered by me. “Elegiac is a nice word, don’t you think? Do you read classics? What’s your favorite? Or do you just read sci-fi?”

“What, *Midwich Cuckoos* isn’t a classic?” I imagined a smirk, a twinkle in those eyes, his raised Irish inflection.

“Lemme check. Mmmm. Questionable, but perhaps. This book cover needs to be burned and never seen again. I’ll say yes in a Ray Bradbury sense; it’s a classic. You win this round.”

“Alright fine. Put your black dress on. Wear heels. We're going out.”

It's going to feel more real when I hand my keys over and realize I have nothing to replace them.

It feels more real when he stands above me, puts his hands on each of my ears, leans down and kisses my forehead sweetly through the dirty strands of my unkempt morning hair.

&nbsp;

<span style="color:#97d700">last tea</span>

We got together one last time for tea before my move. As we hugged and said our goodbyes, he said to me in that street accent he sometimes lets out when he's off guard or bulking up above his emotions, "*Hey!* Hey, let's get tea before you go."

You know we will.

&nbsp;

<span style="color:#97d700">it's starting to come back to me</span>

were the chickens in *Eraserhead* alive?<br>
were they alive on the plates?

*ish*<br>
*they were moving*

I woke up in the middle of the night a couple nights ago, complete sudden wide awake sit up in bed and said, "shit, were they alive?"

*heh*

then I fell back asleep

He smoked the last cigarette then fled to LA to detox. "Just for a few days," he said as he kissed my cheek at the airport. His stubble was a couple days out, coarse. A brief touch that was visceral. Lingering.

I drove back to his place, alone, where the cats greeted me with their sad cries. I shouldn't have bought him that pack of American Spirit.

&nbsp;

<span style="color:#97d700">tertiary need</span>

He detoxed. He came back. He relapsed as he smoked into the new year. That swirl in the air and burn in my body.

&nbsp;

<span style="color:#97d700">delta</span>

But the thing of it was, as we were exiting the plane, she stood up there and actually said “bye-bye” to the air between each passenger.

&nbsp;

<span style="color:#97d700">the knows</span>

"Did you like the movie?" He asked me as the credits started.

"Yeah. I did. I didn't think I would, but I did." How did I not watch it 20 years ago when it was huge?

"Yeah, it's a pretty good movie." He was in the kitchen, cooking. He loves to cook. I was sitting on the sofa, wondering what movie to start next. "The director is a douche though."

"Is he?" I asked, only partially present in the conversation.

"Yeah. He is."

"Wait a minute." I stopped. Looked up. Looked right at him across the loft. Present and fully aware, our dialogue quickly replaying in my mind. He stopped too. Looked across the room to me. I knew he knew what I was about to say. I saw the subtle but pregnant amusement on his face. "How do *you* know he's a douche?"

"He just is."

"Do you know him?"

"Eh, not really." He lowered his gaze and the knife to the board as he got back to the food. "I just know he's a douche."

"Mhmm." I didn't believe him, not really.

He chopped a few vegetables, let the silence roll between us for an appropriate amount of time, then, "I almost bought his house in Brooklyn... but he was a douche."

"Is there anyone you don't know?"

"Lots."

J,

We’re all a little crazy. Some of us better at it than others.

<span style="color:#97d700">truth</span>

I consider heartbroken a success. Maybe not a triumphant one, but one that proves I’ve lived.


&nbsp;

<span style="color:#97d700">redemption</span>

Devastation isn’t such a bad thing. It’s winter. It’s after winter when the snow starts to melt and there are little bulbs of purple and yellow on green, pushing through the dirty white. It’s a fire over the soil so crops grow stronger, later. It’s redemption after the long burn.

<span style="color:#97d700">love & loss</span>

Yesterday I sat on Love for the first time, and I realized why it is I always choose to sit on Loss. Loss is easy. Love is a little uncomfortable and covered in bird feces.

<span style="color:#97d700">reiki</span>

I went in feeling somewhere around seventy percent, and after an hour on his table, I walked away at ninety. Not only did I physically feel better, but for the first time in days, I felt like my body was mine again.

After going through what I went through, after being so clearly aware of losing my physical self, it had been a terrible struggle to feel “whole” again, to feel grounded, but with his help, I felt like me. I felt settled. I felt normal, even. I felt good. I hurt still; my ribs were sore, my back was sore, my chest was sore, my throat was sore, every breath had a wheeze and a rattle, my head had been pounding for days, but I felt good. I felt my body repairing itself. He gave me reason to trust in my body, to have faith in my body, to revel in the wonder that is my body, that after what it went through, it was fixing itself, it was protecting me, it was strong, it was me.
