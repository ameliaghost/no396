I can’t speak highly enough of this book (or the movie). I would like to think that if Jesse James had been from New York or Los Angeles I’d have loved this story just as much, but the truth is there just aren’t enough good stories out there about Kansas City (my hometown), so I’m willing to admit I came to this book with a pretty strong bias in its favor. But just like the movie, the narrative was so gritty and poetic that, bias or no, what I found in Ron Hansen's telling of this story was an unassuming piece of art. 

This reads exactly as the movie plays – most of the lines are word for word. The book goes into more depth, though, where the movie focuses on the relationship and motivations between Jesse James and Bob Ford, the book gives more attention to the relationship between Jesse and his family as well as the dynamic between the James brothers and the Youngers. It is an entertaining read, but it is also funny, heartbreaking and angering. I found myself admiring Jesse James, loving his eccentricities, even justifying his violence. And in the end I felt sorry for him, for the way he died, even though by the life he lived he set himself up for that death. But I also felt for Bob, just a kid swept up in the attention he received from his hero and who ultimately had to face the dilemma of kill or be killed. He suffered the rest of his own short life for the decision he made.

*Charley smiled. “You thought it was all made up, didn’t you. You thought everything was yarns and newspaper stories.”*

*Bob looked over at [Jesse]… “He’s just a human being.”*

Call him Robin Hood, call him V, whoever he was, Jesse James was an interesting folk hero, and for that my proverbial hat’s off to him – from a safe 125 year distance. But it wasn’t thoughts of Jesse James that lingered with me after finishing this book; instead it was Robert Ford.

*Such great heat seemed to come then from Jesse’s eyes that Bob nearly glanced away as from sunlight, but in a second the man cooled and said, “I come to ask one of you two Fords to ride with me on a journey or two. I guess we’ve agreed it ought to be Charley; you’ve been acting sort of testy.”*

*Bob was pale and silent. He stepped around Jesse’s obstructing boot, calmly climbed the stairs to the upper room, and carefully shut the door. Dick shoved open the closet door with his toe and stared at Bob from among the women’s things. “I’d say that was really stupid.”*

*Bob covered his mouth and slid his back down the newspapered wall to a sit.*
