I went to design school. Twice. Do you know what people always ask me? *“Where’d you learn to write?”*

I edit everything I read from menus to Facebook posts. Most people aren’t interested in receiving unsolicited constructive criticism, however, so I suffer their blunders in silence.

As an extension of my interests and abilities, I got a master’s degree
in learning complex, abstract things and researching and writing long, geeky papers. I like to joke that I got my degree in tinkering with design and technology. It’s not a joke, though. It’s remarkably true.

But really, my interest in language and teaching came from my childhood. I was a teenage piano teacher. I had to fight an age bias and find creative ways to earn and keep my students. Music is a language, and I had to generate a language and concepts that my students understood. Each student had a different way of processing information. In the end, I had a low student turnover rate and was pulling in students from more experienced teachers because I figured out how to simplify music into an easy to understand and enjoyable experience.
