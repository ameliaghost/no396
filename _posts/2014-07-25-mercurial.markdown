the fiend within that marauds a heavy soul, of hope and dreams, fragilities, tattered, out of control. feelings lost, despair fights forth and gambles with these days. each moment's burden, empty dark, betrayal, self malaise. the thief steals, the earth reels, blood crawls, heart kneels. come a cure. mercurial.
