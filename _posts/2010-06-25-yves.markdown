We don't have bedroom windows that face each other, we've never sat out under the stars talking about where we are going with our lives, we've never been mischievous together, but to me, you are the proverbial boy next door. The boy who tells me things, and who lets me tell him things. The boy whose happiness makes me smile. The boy whose sorrows make me ache. 

I accept this challenge of taking risks, of helping each other reach our dreams and overcome our failures. When we're hitting the age of the midlife crisis, when our graying peers are lamenting over their wasted lives, we'll remind each other of where we'd be without our risks, our failures and our triumphs. We'll keep each other accountable for not being drop-outs or cop-outs, and we'll push each other to continue our adventures. 

I'll send you a postcard from Sydney. And I swear, I won't go for a trilogy.
